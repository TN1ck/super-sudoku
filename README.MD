# Super Sudoku

This project aims to be a sudoku app with everything included. An open source sudoku that is on par with all commercial applications. Why? Because my Grandma wanted to play a Sudoku once and I didn't like all the available offers. This has changed since then, but having an open source version will hopefully help people in the future.

### Features Done:

- [x] Solving of sudokus
- [x] Generation of sudokus in different difficulties
- [x] Creating a responsive web-app that works on mobile as good as on desktop
- [x] Providing hints for to actually provide a real value over paper based sudokus

### Features Todo:

- [ ] Create a nice animation when the user won
- [ ] Save results of users
- [ ] Provide motivating animations when finishing a line/square
- [ ] Offer users to generate their own unique sudokus
- [ ] Creating a challenge mode so two people can solve the same Sudoku side by side

## Setup

```
npm install
npm start

The app should be available on `https://localhost:3001`.
